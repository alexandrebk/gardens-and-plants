# Gardens and plants ðŸŒ´

Letâ€™s code a Rails app with gardens and plants!


## Spec

Today, students discovered how to handle multi-model apps in Rails. The goal of this livecode is to make sure theyâ€™re comfortable with all the complexity induced.

To do this, weâ€™re going to create an app to create plants associated to a garden, and destroy them.

As a user I can see one garden's plants
As a user I can add a plant in a garden
As a user I can delete a plant

## Frontend setup

Follow [front-end](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-stylesheets/blob/master/README.md) setup guidelines but donâ€™t bother with the Bootstrap JS part
