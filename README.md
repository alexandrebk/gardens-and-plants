# Gardens and plants ğŸŒ´

Letâ€™s code a Rails app with gardens and plants!


## Spec

Weâ€™re going to create an app to create plants associated to a garden, and destroy them.

- [ ] As a user I can see one garden's plants
- [ ] As a user I can add a plant in a garden
- [ ] As a user I can delete a plant

## Frontend setup

Follow [front-end](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-stylesheets/blob/master/README.md) setup guidelines but donâ€™t bother with the Bootstrap JS part

# Gardens and plants II ğŸŒ´

Letâ€™s add tags on our plants and play around a little bit with JS in Rails!
